# RustMyDetection
Mimic a Windows malware in Rust

## Purpose:

To simulate the behaviour of a malware to test the detection and reaction of the operators.  
It is more a toolbox than a complete product

I am not working on a tool for:
  - pentester 
  - redteam

The icons and executable informations are taken from a version of Office 2016.

## Why Rust:

Because I want to learn it and it's fun to try new things

The code is dirty I know and it will get better as I get better

## Todo List:

- [X] Change executable internal name
- [X] Run a external command
- [X] Encode command to bypass string check very basic
- [ ] Download another payload
- [ ] Self-replicated
- [ ] Drop file
